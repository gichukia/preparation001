In the article “The Case Against Grades,” Alfie Khon lays out an in-depth explanation based on decades of research on how grades undermine student’s enthusiasm in their learning. The writer laments that grading discourages students from taking academic risks and ultimately lowers their thinking quality. I agree with the writer that grades are not required to foster achievement, contrary to popular belief. The simple notion that having more data is always a good thing has formed the basis for grading. 

Although imagining an education environment without any form of grading may seem like a fantasy, there sure is a need for a new grading system that would free instructors from grading their students and not assign different levels of performance to other people. Instead, an alternative grading system would ideally focus on one level rubric whose foundation is based on demonstrating that academic objectives have been met.

The article reminded me of four incidences in my undergraduate studies when I received a grade that I did not deserve. In my junior year, I did Theory of Estimation. To my surprise, I got a grade that I did not entirely anticipate because I thought that I had prepared for the exams well and that I deserved an outstanding grade. I have to accept that this incident particularly undermined my enthusiasm for learning for quite a bit, and I had to pick myself up. I was mistaken to think that maybe such an incident would not repeat itself. In my final undergraduate year, the same happened in the Linear Modelling II and Entrepreneurship Skills courses. I received grades that, in my opinion, were not a true reflection of my performance and understanding of the classes. Mainly, I was so disappointed with the grade I got in the Entrepreneurship Skills course because all along, I had seen the unit as the easiest I had taken in the fourth year. Surprisingly, during my freshman year, I also received a grade that I thought was a little bit higher than I expected. 

Without grades, my motivation for learning would be entirely intrinsic – learning for my good – and not partially blinded by the need to score high grades. I would avoid treating graduate school as a game because many students have made the goal of graduate school, and colleges perform well at any price, which is a wrong model of higher education. Without the traditional grading system, a student's focus would shift from schooling to learning, focusing on the essential skills they will need after graduate school and not success and accomplishment through grades. In an ideal grading system, learning would take precedence over grades, and students would be encouraged to focus on learning rather than performance. Students would also shed the fear of risk-taking because they no longer believe that they cannot take a chance on something that hasn't been tried before, thereby encouraging higher-order thinking skills and creativity. Generating a student-centered adventure in learning will allow students to relax and focus on learning, which by itself is motivation enough.
